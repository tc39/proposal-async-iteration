    1. Perform ! PerformPromiseThen(_promiseCapability_.[[Promise]], _onFulfilled_, _onRejected_, _throwawayCapability_).
    1. Remove _asyncContext_ from the execution context stack and restore the execution context that is at the top of the execution context stack as the running execution context.
    1. Set the code evaluation state of _asyncContext_ such that when evaluation is resumed with a Completion _completion_, the following steps of the algorithm that invoked Await will be performed, with _completion_ available.

    <h1>Await Fulfilled Functions</h1>

    <p>An Await fulfilled function is an anonymous built-in function that is used as part of the Await specification device to deliver the promise fulfillment value to the caller as a normal completion. Each Await fulfilled function has an [[AsyncContext]] internal slot.</p>

    <p>When an Await fulfilled function _F_ is called with argument _value_, the following steps are taken:</p>

    <emu-alg>
      1. Let _asyncContext_ be _F_.[[AsyncContext]].

      1. Suspend _prevContext_.
      1. Push _asyncContext_ onto the execution context stack; _asyncContext_ is now the running execution context.
      1. Resume the suspended evaluation of _asyncContext_ using NormalCompletion(_value_) as the result of the operation that suspended it.
      1. Assert: When we reach this step, _asyncContext_ has already been removed from the execution context stack and _prevContext_ is the currently running execution context.
